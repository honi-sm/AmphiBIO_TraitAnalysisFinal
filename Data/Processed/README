## Overview
This repository is a squeaky clean subset of amphibian trait data derived from the global AmphiBIO dataset.  
Raw dataset included 6,777 rows representing amphibian species with varying levels of data collection, some had NA.  
My Cooked dataset has 1,481 species with complete trait information, retained in a seed for further analysis.

This one focuses on five variables that describe morphology and reproduction:
- Adult body length (mm)
- Minimum and maximum clutch size
- Habitat type (fossorial, terrestrial, aquatic, arboreal)
- Primary reproductive mode (direct, larval, or viviparous)

A simple random sample of 500 species generated for analysis.

## Data Summary

| File | Rows | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `data/rawData.xlsx` | 6,777 | Unfiltered raw dataset |
| `data/cleanData.xlsx` | 1,481 | Cleaned and verified dataset |
| `data/randomSample_500.xlsx` | 500 | Random subset for statistical analysis |
| `docs/metadata.md` | — | Variable definitions and data structure |
| `docs/processing_notes.md` | — | Complete data-cleaning workflow and validation log |

## Cleaning and Validation
- Rows missing key numeric fields (`Body_size_mm`, `Litter_size_min_n`, `Litter_size_max_n`) were removed.  
- Binary habitat fields (`Fos`, `Ter`, `Aqu`, `Arb`) were collapsed into one combined text column (`habitatType`).  
- Reproductive mode binaries (`Dir`, `Lar`, `Viv`) were combined into one categorical field (`reproductiveMethod`).  
- Columns were renamed to standardized, machine-readable headers (`bodyLengthMm`, `clutchSizeMinN`, `clutchSizeMaxN`).  
- Duplicate species were removed, retaining 1,481 unique records.  
- All retained fields were cross-checked with the original raw dataset using Excel `INDEX/MATCH` verification to confirm value alignment.  
- Numeric fields were reviewed for outliers and biologically implausible values; none were detected.

## Sampling
A random column was generated in Excel using `RANDBETWEEN(1,1481)`, frozen via Paste-Values, and sorted ascending.  
The first 500 rows were selected as a random sample without replacement.  
This subset was saved as `randomSample_500.xlsx` for statistical analysis.

For a population size of 1,481, a sample size of 500 yields a 95 % confidence margin of error of approximately ±3.6 %.

## Intended Use
This dataset supports research in ecology, evolutionary biology, and biostatistics.  
It can be used for trait-based analyses, teaching exercises in data cleaning, or reproducibility demonstrations in Python or R, as I will do later.

## Reproducibility
Replication scripts are provided:
- `scripts/clean_dataset.py` — Python version (pandas)
- `scripts/clean_dataset.R` — R version (dplyr)
