# AmphiBIO_TraitAnalysisFinal
Statistical analysis of global amphibian trait data using the AmphiBIO database. Developed as part of the Statistics for Information Science &amp; Technology course at the University of Nebraska Omaha.

## Project Overview
Hihi!!!! :> 
This project explores statistical relationships between amphibian body size, reproductive mode, and habitat type using data from the AmphiBIO Global Amphibian Traits Database. It demonstrates the application of statistical inference methods to biological trait data.

### Repository Structure
- `00_CleanedData/` – data cleaning, validation, and sampling
- `001_Assumptions/` – assumption testing and diagnostics
- `01_Descriptive/` descriptive visuals of variance, mean, stdev, etc
- `02_Inferential/` – hypothesis tests, regression models, and robustness checks

## Future Directions

This analysis prioritizes inference and interpretation over prediction. While robust
methods were used to address assumption violations, the goal was not to build or tune
predictive models.

Future work could explore phylogenetic structure, sensitivity analyses, or
cross-validated models if the research question were expanded. These directions were
deliberately beyond the scope of the present project.
