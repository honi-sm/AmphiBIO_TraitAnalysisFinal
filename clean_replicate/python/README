This folder holds the cleaned and processed datasets generated by my Python AmphiBIO analysis pipeline.
These files are created automatically when the notebook runs, so nothing here is hand-edited.

Files in this folder
cleanDataPython.csv
cleanedDataCheck.py

The dataset in csv contains

Species — standardized lowercase species names
bodyLengthMm — body length in mm
clutchSizeMinN — minimum clutch size
clutchSizeMaxN — maximum clutch size
habitatType — combined habitat label (e.g., "terrestrial + aquatic")
reproductiveMethod — "larval", "direct", or "viviparous"

All missing-value cleanup, zero-to-NaN fixes, numeric casting, and duplicate removal has been applied.

Should be around 1480 rows depending on exact filtering, got 1481 in manually excel, 1484 with this code

randomSample_500_python.csv

A reproducible 500-species sample generated using:
random_seed = 2025


I use this for quick statistical testing or smaller exploratory analyses without loading the full dataset.

These files are outputs, you don’t need to edit them manually (please don’t lol).
If they look wrong, re-run the Python notebook; it will regenerate them cleanly.
The raw dataset (AmphiBIOv1Raw.xlsx) is not stored here, stored in repo.
